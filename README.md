#SOLID Principles Demonstration

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/nickbdyer/solid-isp/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/nickbdyer/solid-isp)

Week 2 Day 1 at Makers Academy

###Interface Segregation Principle

The included files were used as examples for a group demonstration on the SOLID Principles. Our group was responsible for presenting on ISP. 

####Lessons Learned
- S - SRP - Single Repsonsibility Principle
    > A class should have only a single responsibility. 
- O - OCP - Open/Closed Principle
    > Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- L - LSP - Liskov Substitution Principle
    > Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their child/sub-types without altering the applicability of the program.
- I - ISP - Interface Segregation Principle
    > Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general interface.
- D - DIP - Dependency Inversion Principle
    > High-Level modules should not depend on low-level. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should also not depend on details, but details should depend on abstractions.

####Quotes:
>when a client depends upon a class that contains interfaces
>that the client does not use, but that other clients do use,
>then that client will be affected by the changes that those 
>other clients force upon the class
