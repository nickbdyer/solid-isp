Interface Segregation Principles

Quotes:

>when a client depends upon a class that contains interfaces
>that the client does not use, but that other clients do use,
>then that client will be affected by the changes that those 
>other clients force upon the class

>High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
>Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
