SOLID Principles Demonstration

Interface Segregation Principles

Quotes:

>when a client depends upon a class that contains interfaces
>that the client does not use, but that other clients do use,
>then that client will be affected by the changes that those 
>other clients force upon the class

>High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
>Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.

>ISP usually applies to other OO languages such as c# and c++, 
which use 'Interfaces' and 'abstractions. 
This doesn't apply directly to ruby. So we have tried to demonstrate 
these principles as best we can, using some elements of ruby, like Modules, and Classes.
